PROJECT RULES – NASHUR APP

1. This app is a VOICE-LOCKED alarm.
   Never add a stop button.

   when the alarm rings.

   Accept imperfect pronunciation.

4. UX must resemble Android Clock behavior
   but with custom Islamic luxury styling.

5. Dark mode only.
   No light mode.

6. No login, no cloud, no tracking.

7. All code must remain modular and readable.

8. This app is spiritually sensitive:
   UI must feel calm, respectful, and focused.

Any future code must respect these rules.
